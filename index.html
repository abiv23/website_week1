                <p><img src='assets/images/faried.jpg' class='article-image'> Change is on it's way in the form of the youth movement in Denver. A 26 year-old Kenneth Faried is considered possibly too old for this core's competitive window. His stellar play in team USA world games
                    aside, Faried has been the same player since his breakout rookie year. The Manimal is likely on the block to free up minutes to the Baltic Block party, Jokic and Nurkic.

                <p><img src='assets/images/murray.jpg' class='article-image'> Back-to-back top 10 picks by the Nuggets are primary ball handling guards. Mudiay&rsquo;s a tall PG at 6&rsquo;5 with the ability to see the entire court and top-shelf athleticism for
                    his position. Elite potential on defense, but it&rsquo;s all &rsquo;want to&rsquo; on that end of the floor, many players with the tools never develop on D. Murray is a shooting guard in a combo guards body. He can stroke the ball
                    or dunk on your big man. Murray continues the international melting pot as our own Maple Jordan.
